Is AI friend or foe? In AutoClaw, you can find that out! The AI may, or may not, help you to collect items in a claw machine.

**How to play:**

To start with, you get assigned an item to collect. You must use the arrow buttons on the side to program the claw. But wait! An AI has access to these controls too! This AI can help, or ruin, the journey to your assigned item.

Once you have programmed the movements, press the "Go" button and the claw will run your instructions.

To win you must collect all of the items in the grid.
